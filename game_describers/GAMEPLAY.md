# Gameplay Overview for Multiplayer Planetary Shooter

This document outlines the core gameplay mechanics, player experience, and overall vision for the Multiplayer Planetary Shooter.

## Core Concept

Multiplayer Planetary Shooter is a fast-paced, third-person shooter set in a dynamic solar system. Players battle across diverse planets, each with unique gravitational fields and environmental hazards. The game's physics and core mechanics are deeply integrated with real-world mathematical constants and advanced concepts, creating a unique and ever-changing battlefield.

## Gameplay Loop

The primary gameplay loop consists of:
1.  **Spawning and Gearing Up**: Players spawn on a planet and can choose from a variety of weapons.
2.  **Combat**: Engage in fast-paced combat with other players online.
3.  **Planetary Travel**: Use a personal rocket to travel between different planets, each offering a different combat environment.
4.  **Adapting**: Players must adapt to the unique physics of each planet and leverage the environment to their advantage.
5.  **Mathematical Chaos**: The game world is influenced by mathematical principles, causing subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) changes to physics, weapon behavior, and visuals.

## Key Features

### Multiplayer Combat
-   **Real-time Action**: Up to 16 players can join a server for intense deathmatch-style combat.
-   **Diverse Arsenal**: A selection of weapons including rifles, shotguns, snipers, and explosive weapons like grenades and rockets. Each weapon has distinct characteristics.
-   **Skill-Based**: While mathematical chaos adds unpredictability, player skill in aiming, movement, and tactical decision-making remains crucial.

### Planetary Exploration
-   **Multiple Planets**: Battle on Earth, Mars, the Moon, Jupiter, and Venus.
-   **Unique Environments**: Each planet has a unique sky color, ground color, obstacle layout, and most importantly, a different gravitational pull. Low-gravity on the Moon allows for high jumps, while Jupiter's high gravity will challenge player movement.
-   **Rocket Travel**: Seamlessly travel between planets to escape a fight or seek out new opponents.

### Advanced Physics and Mathematical Integration
-   **Dynamic Physics Zones**: Encounter zones with zero gravity, magnetic fields that alter projectile paths, wind zones, and time dilation fields.
-   **Destructible Environments**: Some objects in the world can be destroyed, altering the battlefield.
-   **Soft-Body Physics**: Interact with dynamic soft-body objects like cloth and jelly cubes that react realistically to forces.
-   **Mathematical Influence**: The game is underpinned by a "mathematical engine" that uses constants like the fine-structure constant (Î±) to influence game variables. This creates a layer of emergent complexity, where the rules of the game are constantly in flux.

## Player Experience
The intended experience is one of chaotic fun and mastery. New players can jump in and enjoy the fast-paced shooting. Veteran players will learn to read and adapt to the subtle mathematical effects, predict environmental shifts, and use the advanced physics to outplay their opponents. The game should feel both familiar as a shooter and refreshingly unpredictable due to its unique mathematical and physical systems.
