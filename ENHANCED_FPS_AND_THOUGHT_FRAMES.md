```javascript
// Fire weapon with advanced combat mechanics
const weaponFired = game.enhancedFPS.fireWeapon();

if (weaponFired) {
  // Automatic hit detection and damage calculation
  // Visual feedback generation
  // Combat analytics update
  // Thought monitoring integration

```javascript
// Environmental impact handling
game.enhancedFPS.handleEnvironmentalImpact(projectile, hitPoint, weapon);

// Get environmental statistics
const envStats = game.enhancedFPS.getEnvironmentalStatistics();
console.log(`Destructible objects: ${envStats.destructibleObjects}`);
```

### Thought Frame Management

```javascript
// Get prioritized thought frames
const priorities = game.getPrioritizedThoughtFrames(5);

// Complete a thought frame
game.completeThoughtFrame('advanced_combat_mechanics', {
  implemented: true,
  features: ['hit detection', 'damage system', 'visual feedback'],
