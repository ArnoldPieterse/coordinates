- `POST /api/system/restart` - System restart (simulated)

#### AI Agent Management
- `GET /api/agents` - List all AI agents
- `POST /api/agents/spawn` - Create new AI agent
- `DELETE /api/agents/:agentId` - Dismiss agent
- `PUT /api/agents/:agentId/upgrade` - Upgrade agent capabilities

#### Job Management
- `GET /api/jobs` - List all jobs

#### Player Management
- `GET /api/players` - List all players
- `POST /api/players/join` - Join game as player
- `PUT /api/players/:playerId/position` - Update player position
- `POST /api/players/:playerId/shoot` - Handle combat actions

#### Game Management
- `GET /api/game/status` - Game statistics and status
- `POST /api/game/start` - Start game for player
- `POST /api/game/pause` - Pause game for player

### 2. **Frontend Integration**

#### Updated Services
- **AI Agent Service** (`src/unified-ui/services/aiAgentService.js`)
  - Now uses real API endpoints instead of mock data
  - Handles agent spawning, dismissal, upgrades
  - Manages job creation, cancellation, prioritization
  - Real-time updates via polling

- **Game Service** (`src/unified-ui/services/gameService.js`)
  - New service for player and game management
  - Handles player joining, position updates, combat
  - Manages game state (start, pause, resume)

#### Enhanced UI Components
- **Play Component** (`src/unified-ui/pages/Play.jsx`)
  - Integrated with real game service
  - Player join form with validation
  - Real-time player status display
  - Enhanced game UI with player info
  - Keyboard controls initialization

#### Improved Styling
- **Enhanced CSS** (`src/unified-ui/style.css`)
  - Modern game menu with join form
  - Player info displays
  - Enhanced game UI with stats bars
  - Responsive design for mobile
  - Safari compatibility fixes

### 3. **Comprehensive Testing**

#### API Test Suite (`api-test-suite.js`)
- **10 test categories** covering all endpoints
- **Performance testing** with concurrent operations
- **Error handling** validation
