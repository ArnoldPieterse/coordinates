# Gameplay: Artist-Driven LOD, Animation, Presets, Collaboration

## 1. LOD and Animation Controls
### 1.1 LOD UI
- Provide sliders or dropdowns for global/per-branch LOD.
- Example:
```js
// UI slider for LOD
<input type="range" min="0" max="3" value="1" onchange="setLOD(this.value)">
```

### 1.2 Real-Time Preview
- Update tree mesh in real-time as LOD/animation parameters change.

### 1.3 Animation/Seasonal Parameter Controls
- Expose animation curves, seasonal transitions, and wind effects in UI.

## 2. Presets and Customization
### 2.1 Preset Library
- Load, customize, and save tree presets (e.g., Oak, Pine, Willow).
- Example:
```js
function loadPreset(name) {
  const preset = presetLibrary[name];
  applyPreset(preset);
}
```

### 2.2 User Preset Management
- Allow users to save/load their own presets.
- Support import/export as JSON.

## 3. Collaborative Editing & Versioning
### 3.1 Real-Time Collaboration
- Sync node graph and parameters between users (WebSocket, CRDT, etc.).
- Show collaborator cursors and edit history.

### 3.2 Version Control
- Track changes, allow undo/redo, and branch/merge edits.
