        - all
```
- **Purpose**: On-demand workflow execution
- **Jobs**: All jobs based on selected action

### 3. Issue Events
```yaml
issues:
  types: [opened, labeled, closed]
```
- **Purpose**: Respond to issue activity
- **Jobs**: `ai-agent-invitation`

### 4. Pull Request Events
```yaml
pull_request:
  types: [opened, synchronize, closed]
```
- **Purpose**: Monitor PR activity for collaboration opportunities
- **Jobs**: `ai-progress-tracking`

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```yaml
env:
  WORKFLOW_VERSION: '2.0.0'
  MAX_RETRIES: 3
  TIMEOUT_MINUTES: 30
```

### Permissions
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
  actions: read
```

### Concurrency Control
Each job uses concurrency groups to prevent conflicts:
```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ai-invitation-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Error Handling
- **Try-catch blocks** in all JavaScript steps
- **set -e** in shell scripts for immediate failure
- **Graceful degradation** with fallback values
- **Detailed error messages** for debugging

### 2. Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: pip cache for Python dependencies
- **Concurrency control** to prevent conflicts
- **Timeout limits** to prevent infinite runs
- **Efficient API calls** with Promise.all

### 3. Security
- **Minimal permissions** required
- **No hardcoded secrets** in workflow
- **Input validation** for manual triggers
- **Secure artifact retention** (30 days)

### 4. Monitoring & Debugging
- **Comprehensive logging** with emojis for readability
- **Artifact uploads** for post-run analysis
- **Step outputs** for job communication
- **Workflow summaries** for quick status

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Job Skipped
**Problem**: Job doesn't run when expected
**Solution**: Check the `if:` condition for the job
```yaml
# Example: Job only runs on manual trigger with specific action
if: |
  github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && 
  (github.event.inputs.action == 'invitation' || github.event.inputs.action == 'all')
```

#### 2. Permission Denied
**Problem**: API calls fail with permission errors
**Solution**: Verify workflow permissions in repository settings
```yaml
permissions:
  issues: write  # Required for creating issues
  pull-requests: write  # Required for PR operations
```

#### 3. Timeout Issues
**Problem**: Jobs take too long and timeout
**Solution**: Increase timeout or optimize the job
```yaml
timeout-minutes: 60  # Increase from default 30
```

#### 4. API Rate Limits
**Problem**: GitHub API calls fail due to rate limiting
**Solution**: Implement retry logic or reduce API calls
```javascript
// Example retry logic
const maxRetries = 3;
for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
  try {
    await github.rest.issues.create({...});
    break;
  } catch (error) {
    if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error;
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * (i + 1)));
  }
}
```

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Workflow Logs**: Review the detailed logs in GitHub Actions
2. **Download Artifacts**: Use uploaded artifacts for post-run analysis
3. **Verify Triggers**: Ensure the workflow is triggered by the expected event
4. **Check Permissions**: Verify repository settings allow the required permissions
5. **Test Manually**: Use workflow_dispatch to test specific jobs

## üìà Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Workflow Success Rate**: Percentage of successful runs
- **Job Execution Time**: Time taken by each job
- **Issue Creation Rate**: Number of issues created per run
- **Error Frequency**: Common failure points and patterns

### Log Analysis
- **Artifact Downloads**: Check uploaded logs for detailed analysis
- **Step Outputs**: Use job outputs for cross-job communication
- **Workflow Summaries**: Quick status overview in GitHub UI

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Update Dependencies**: Keep actions and tools up to date
2. **Review Permissions**: Ensure minimal required permissions
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track execution times and optimize
4. **Update Documentation**: Keep this README current
