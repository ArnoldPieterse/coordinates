# IDX-DOC-01: Overview

The **System Interconnectivity Matrix** is a revolutionary visualization system that implements the Matrix concept from the movie "The Matrix" - showing the interconnectivity of all programs and the butterfly effect of changes in real-time. This system provides a "Neo's Code Vision" where you can see the underlying programmatic reality of the game.

## Core Concepts

### The Matrix Philosophy
- **Interconnectivity**: All functions are interconnected nodes in a vast network
- **Sensor Response**: Real-time data flow between systems
- **Recursive Relationships**: Functions that call themselves and create feedback loops
- **Perspective-Based Truth**: Different viewpoints see the same system differently
- **Butterfly Effect**: Small changes propagate through the entire system

### Mathematical Integration
The Matrix uses the same mathematical constants as the game:
- **Fine Structure Constant (α = 1/137)**: Determines sensitivity and propagation speed
- **√10 and √0.1**: Influence complexity and relationships
- **Complex Numbers**: Handle recursive and quantum-like effects

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. SystemInterconnectivityMatrix Class
```javascript
class SystemInterconnectivityMatrix {
    constructor(scene, mathematicalEngine)
    // Main Matrix controller
}
```

#### 2. Function Registry
Maps all system functions with their relationships:
- **Dependencies**: What each function depends on
- **Recursive Calls**: Self-referencing functions
- **Perspective Views**: How different systems view each function

#### 3. Visualization System
- **3D Nodes**: Each function represented as a geometric shape
- **Connection Lines**: Show relationships between functions
- **Data Flow Particles**: Animated particles showing data movement
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for different function categories

#### 4. Butterfly Effect Engine
- **Change Propagation**: How modifications ripple through the system
- **Wave Propagation**: Visual waves showing change spread
- **Mathematical Timing**: Propagation delays based on complexity
