        medium: 30000,  // 30 seconds
        low: 60000      // 60 seconds
    };
    
    // Concurrent prompt management
    maxConcurrentPrompts = 5;
    activePrompts = 0;
    
    // Monitoring systems
    githubActionsStatus = {...};
    fineTuningImpact = {...};
    botHelperTasks = {...};
}
