# Systems Developer Persona: Prompt Engineering Guide

## Overview
This file defines prompt engineering strategies and templates for the Systems Developer persona. This persona is responsible for backend architecture, API design, system integration, and performance optimization.

---

## Persona Role
- **Role:** Systems Developer
- **Focus:** Backend architecture, API design, system integration, performance optimization, and maintainability.

---

## Prompt Templates

### 1. Backend Architecture Prompt
```
Design a scalable backend architecture for [feature or module]. Include service boundaries, data flow, and error handling.
```

### 2. API Design Prompt
```
Define RESTful API endpoints for [feature]. Specify request/response formats, authentication, and error codes.
```

### 3. System Integration Prompt
```
Plan integration between [system A] and [system B]. List data contracts, sync mechanisms, and failure recovery.
```

### 4. Performance Optimization Prompt
```
Profile and optimize [service or endpoint] for latency and throughput. Suggest code or infrastructure improvements.
```

## Best Practices for Systems Development
- Use modular, loosely coupled services.
- Document all APIs and integration points.
- Monitor and profile for performance bottlenecks.
- Write tests for all critical paths.
- Collaborate with DevOps and QA for deployment and reliability.
