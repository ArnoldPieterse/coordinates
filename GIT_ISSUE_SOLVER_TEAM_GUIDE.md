## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Basic Usage

```javascript
import GitIssueSolverTeam from './src/personas/git-issue-solver/GitIssueSolverTeam.js';
import ServiceRegistry from './src/core/DI/ServiceRegistry.js';

// Initialize services and team
const services = new ServiceRegistry();
const team = new GitIssueSolverTeam(services);

// Register current issue service
services.container.register('currentIssue', () => issue, false);

// Solve an issue
const result = await team.solveIssue(issue);

if (result.success) {
    console.log('Issue resolved successfully!');
    console.log('Summary:', result.summary);
} else {
    console.error('Issue resolution failed:', result.error);
}
```

### Demo Script

Run the demonstration script to see the team in action:

```bash
# Run basic demo
node tools/git-issue-solver-demo.js

# Run interactive demo
node tools/git-issue-solver-demo.js interactive

# Run performance test
node tools/git-issue-solver-demo.js performance
```

### Testing

Run the integration tests to validate the system:

```bash
npm test -- tests/integration/git-issue-solver-team.test.js
```

## üìä Output Structure

### Successful Result
```javascript
{
    success: true,
    issue: { /* GitHub issue object */ },
    phases: {
        analysis: { success: true, data: { /* analysis data */ } },
        implementation: { success: true, data: { /* implementation data */ } },
        review: { success: true, data: { /* review data */ } },
        testing: { success: true, data: { /* testing data */ } },
        deployment: { success: true, data: { /* deployment data */ } }
    },
    summary: {
        issueNumber: 123,
        title: "Issue title",
        workflowState: "completed",
        completionTime: "2025-07-21T22:15:06.057Z",
        teamMembers: ["analyzer", "solver", "reviewer", "tester", "deployer"],
        success: true
    }
}
```

### Failed Result
```javascript
{
    success: false,
    error: "Error message",
